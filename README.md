# 🔍 Databricks WAF Light Tooling

## 🚀 Overview

**Databricks WAF Light Tooling** is a lightweight, automated assessment tool built to evaluate Databricks Lakehouse implementations against the **Well-Architected Framework (WAF)** principles. It analyzes system tables, logs, and metadata to generate real-time scores and actionable recommendations that drive better governance, security, performance, and cost-efficiency.

## ❗ Problem Statement

Building a secure, efficient, and well-governed Databricks Lakehouse requires continuous adherence to WAF principles. However, the assessments generally suffer from:

- ⏱️ Time-consuming processes  
- 🔁 Inconsistencies in evaluation  
- ⚙️ Lack of automation  

---

## 🌟 Opportunity Statement

A **WAF Tool** can solve these pain points by offering:

- ✅ Automated WAF assessments  
- 📊 Real-time scoring  
- 🛠 Actionable insights  

…empowering customers to continuously optimize their Databricks environments with minimal effort.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Develop a **lightweight WAF assessment tool** that:

- Automates analysis using **System Tables**, **audit logs**, and **workspace metadata**  
- Provides **real-time scoring** against WAF pillars  
- Highlights **gaps and improvement opportunities**  
- Offers **low-friction deployment** for both internal teams and customers

## 🛠 Existing Alternatives

- Many teams build **custom dashboards** for monitoring.
- These are often:
  - ❌ Manually maintained  
  - ❌ Inconsistent across customers
